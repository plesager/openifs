> Note: OpenIFS, as with the IFS, is constantly tested with a wide range of compilers, e.g. gnu/gcc, intel and cray. Even with this testing, we cannot and do not guarantee all release branches will be compatible with all compiler versions.

## Installing and Building OpenIFS

### Clone OpenIFS

OpenIFS is available directly from this repository and it can be extracted by either cloning or downloading the package:

* Extract just the release branch using a shallow clone that targets a specific release branch, e.g.
  * `git clone --depth 1 --branch openifs-lts/CY48R1.1 --single-branch https://github.com/ecmwf-ifs/openifs.git openifs-48r1.1`
* Extract a tagged release (shallow clone):
  * `git clone --depth 1 --branch openifs-48r1.1.0 --single-branch https://github.com/ecmwf-ifs/openifs.git openifs-48r1.1.0`

> Note: cloning a tag will result in a detached HEAD. If you plan to make commits, create a branch at that tag after cloning:

```bash
cd TAG
git switch -c my-branch-at-TAG
```

where TAG is the tag in the repository.

### Building OpenIFS

In this section, the build and test process is defined assuming the pre-requisites exist and OpenIFS has been extracted.

Section [Docker install of OpenIFS](#docker-install-of-openifs) describes how to automate this process using a docker container.

#### Set up the platform configuration file

The OpenIFS model requires a number of Linux global environment variables to be set for both installation and runs. These environment variables are defined and set in the `oifs-config.edit_me.sh` file, which can be found in the top-level of your extracted OpenIFS package.

The most important environment variable in `oifs-config.edit_me.sh` is `OIFS_HOME`, which is required by both model build and run scripts. For a description of other variables please refer to [OpenIFS-env-vars](docs/oifs_env_vars.md).

Once edited, the platform configuration file is loaded using the following command:

```bash
source /path/to/file/location/oifs-config.edit_me.sh
```

For example, if you extracted OpenIFS into `$HOME/openifs`, the platform file would be loaded using

```bash
source $HOME/openifs/oifs-config.edit_me.sh
```

#### OpenIFS build

The build and initial test of OpenIFS is controlled by the script `$OIFS_HOME/scripts/build_test/openifs-test.sh`.

Once the platform configuration file, `oifs-config.edit_me.sh` has been sourced (see previous section), OpenIFS can be built using the following commands:

```bash
cd $OIFS_HOME
$OIFS_TEST/openifs-test.sh -cb
```

where:

`$OIFS_TEST` is defined in the platform configuration file (`oifs-config.edit_me.sh`) as `$OIFS_HOME/scripts/build_test`.

* `-c`  creates `source` directory in `$OIFS_HOME`, which is used to collect all the sources defined in the `bundle.yml`, in preparation for the build
* `-b`  builds `source`. This step creates the directory `build` in `$OIFS_HOME`, which is used to build and store the OpenIFS and SCM executables.

For more details about `openifs-test.sh` and the available options please refer to [OpenIFS-build-options](docs/oifs_build_options.md).

### Test OpenIFS build

Once executables are successfully built, they can be tested using the following command

```bash
cd $OIFS_HOME
$OIFS_TEST/openifs-test.sh -t
```

where

* `-t` invokes the testing simulations, which are coarse resolution T21 tests, comprising 21 3-D NWP tests with and without chemistry and 1 SCM test (based on TWP-ICE).

> Note:
> OpenIFS build and test can be run together using `$OIFS_TEST/openifs-test.sh -cbt`.
> The defaults in `oifs-config.edit_me.sh` set the host and site to `local`, which assumes that all the dependencies are installed and available locally.
> If running on an HPC, it is probably necessary to use an arch file. For example, if running on ECMWF HPC either set `OIFS_HOST` and `OIFS_PLATFORM` in `oifs-config.edit_me.sh` as follows:

```bash
export OIFS_HOST="ecmwf"
export OIFS_PLATFORM="hpc2020"
```

> or use `$OIFS_TEST/openifs-test.sh -cbt --arch=./arch/ecmwf/hpc2020/gnu` or `$OIFS_TEST/openifs-test.sh -cbt --arch=./arch/ecmwf/hpc2020/intel`, depending on whether you want to use the Intel or GNU compiler.

If everything has worked correctly with the build of OpenIFS, then all tests should have passed and the `openifs-test.sh` returns the following

```bash
[INFO]: Good news - ctest has passed
        openifs is ready for experiment and SCM testing
----------------------------------------------------------------
END ifstest on OpenIFS build
```

100% pass with `$OIFS_TEST/openifs-test.sh -cbt` shows that the low resolution (t21) ifs-test cases can run to completion on the chosen system. These tests do not check bit comparability with known good output. If this is a requirement, e.g., if a user makes a code change and needs to test whether the code has led to unexpected behaviour in the code, then please refer to [OpenIFS-test-options](docs/oifs_test_options.md).

### Docker install of OpenIFS

The previous section, [Installing and Building OpenIFS](#installing-and-building-openifs), describes the pre-requisites and build process for OpenIFS on a generic Linux based system.

[create-oifs-docker.py](scripts/bootstrap/docker/create-oifs-docker.py) and associated scripts and configuration automates the process described in section [Installing and Building OpenIFS](#installing-and-building-openifs), by creating a Docker container, installing OpenIFS and dependencies and then building OpenIFS and running the test.

* Please go to [OpenIFS Docker Builder](scripts/bootstrap/docker/README.md) for details about the Docker install.

[create-oifs-docker.py](scripts/bootstrap/docker/create-oifs-docker.py) and the resulting Docker development has been tested on macOS but it can be applied to other systems, as long as Docker is installed and the appropriate python dependencies are available.

## Install the static input data files for OpenIFS

OpenIFS requires **static input data** to run forecast experiments. Many of these static data files **are specific for** the respective **model cycle**.

* This static data needs to be found at the `$OIFS_DATA_DIR` location.
* As a minimum you will require the packages `rtables.tar.gz` and `ifsdata.tar.gz` and **at least one** of the packages for a specific horizontal grid resolution (e.g. `48r1_climate.v020_159.tar.gz` for T159).

Create the required directory structure, then download and install the static files by following these steps:

```
# Always do this first:
source </path/to/installtion>/oifs-config.edit_me.sh

# Step 1 - Create the directory structure for static files:
mkdir -p $OIFS_DATA_DIR
cd $OIFS_DATA_DIR
mkdir -p ifsdata rtables climate.v020

# Step 2 - Download and extract radiation table files:
cd ../rtables
wget https://openifs.ecmwf.int/data/ifsdata/48r1/rtables/rtables.tar.gz
tar -xvzf rtables.tar.gz

# Step 3 - Download and extract resolution-independent data files:
cd ifsdata
wget https://openifs.ecmwf.int/data/ifsdata/48r1/ifsdata/ifsdata.tar.gz
tar -xvzf ifsdata.tar.gz

# Step 4 - Download and extract resolution-dependent data files:
cd ../climate.v020
wget https://openifs.ecmwf.int/data/ifsdata/48r1/climate.v020/48r1_climate.v020_159.tar.gz
tar -xvzf 48r1_climate.v020_159.tar.gz

# You should repeat Step 4 for all additional grid resolutions that you intend to use.
# Browse available resolutions here: https://openifs.ecmwf.int/data/ifsdata/48r1/climate.v020/
```

## Run a standard OpenIFS 3-D NWP experiment

Here follows a step-by-step guide how to run a global forecast experiment. A more detailed description on these steps can be found in [How to run global forecast experiments](docs/oifs_howto_run_experiments.md).

### Set up the experiment directory

An **example forecast experiment** has been prepared for OpenIFS 48r1. The experiment ID is `ab7z` and you can download the tarball from here: https://openifs.ecmwf.int/data/experiments/48r1/2016-09-25_Karl/ab7z.tar.gz

* Set variable `OIFS_EXPT` in `oifs-config.edit_me.sh` to point to a suitable location path for your model experiment and extract the experiment data package.
* Copy the model run scripts into the experiment directory.

To carry out the above steps run the following commands in your terminal:

```
source </path/to/installation>/oifs-config.edit_me.sh  # always do this first
cd $OIFS_EXPT
wget https://openifs.ecmwf.int/data/experiments/48r1/2016-09-25_Karl/ab7z.tar.gz
tar -xvzf ab7z.tar.gz
cd $OIFS_EXPT/ab7z/2016092500
cp $OIFS_RUN_SCRIPT/oifs-run .
cp $OIFS_RUN_SCRIPT/run-oifs.ecmwf-hpc2020.job .
```

Edit the experiment configuration file `exp-config.h` and adjust the number of MPI tasks and OpenMP threads to values that are suitable for your computing system.

**exp-config.h:**
```
#--- required variables for this experiment:
 
# this is specific for each experiment:
OIFS_EXPID="ab7z"       #  your experiment ID
OIFS_RES="159"          #  the spectral grid resolution (here: T159)
OIFS_GRIDTYPE="l"       #  the grid type, either 'l' for linear reduced grid, 

# note: use of the batch job script will overwrite these values:
OIFS_NPROC=4            #  the number of MPI tasks
OIFS_NTHREAD=4          #  the number of OpenMP threads

# postprocessing is optional but recommended:
OIFS_PPROC=true         #  enable postprocessing of model output after the model run
OUTPUT_ROOT=$(pwd)      #  folder where pproc output is created (only used if 
                        #  OIFS_PPROC=true). In this example an output folder is 
                        #  created in the experiment directory.

LFORCE=true             #  overwrite existing symbolic links in the experiment directory
LAUNCH=""               #  the platform specific run command for the MPI environment
                        #  (e.g. "mpirun", "srun", etc). Setting this variable overwrites 
                        #  any platform-specific default run commands defined in oifs-run
 
#--- optional variables that can be set for this experiment:
 
#OIFS_NAMELIST='my-fort.4'               # custom atmospheric model namelist file
#OIFS_EXEC="<custom-path>/ifsMASTER.DP"  # model executable to be used for this experiment
```

### Running the experiment

Now the model run can be started. Depending on the available hardware the experiment can either be run interactively or as a batch job.

#### Running interactively:

If your computing system is capable of running programes in hybrid parallel configuration (MPI/OpenMP) then you can run the model interactively. 

* In order to run the experiment interactively, execute the `oifs-run` script from the command line in your terminal.

```
# run interactively:
source </path/to/installation>/oifs-config.edit_me.sh
cd $OIFS_EXPT/ab7z/2016092500
./oifs-run
```

#### Running a batch job:

This method is the preferred way to run OpenIFS, as it is more efficient and it allows more flexibility in using the available hardware resources. 

* The job wrapper script `run-oifs.ecmwf-hpc2020.job` has been designed for the ECMWF hpc2020 HPC and might need adjusting for your local computing system. 
* Edit this file and adjust the header lines for the batch scheduler as required.
* Edit the variable `PLATFORM_CFG` to point to your `oifs-config.edit_me.sh` file.

Once you have made the appropriate changes the job can be submitted:

```
# run as slurm batch job:
source </path/to/installation>/oifs-config.edit_me.sh
cd $OIFS_EXPT/ab7z/2016092500
sbatch ./run-oifs.ecmwf-hpc2020.job
```

>NOTE: The job wrapper script will read the exp-config.h file and adopt the selected values. The exceptions are `LAUNCH`, which is set to "srun" for batch jobs, and `OIFS_NPROC` & `OIFS_NTHREAD` for which values from the batch job headers are used. The job wrapper script modifies the `exp-config.h` file accordingly prior to calling the `oifs-run` script.

## Run a standard OpenIFS SCM case

Since OpenIFS-48r1 was released in 2024, the Single Column Model (SCM) has been available and is built by default when OpenIFS is built. In this section we present an overview about how to set-up and run the SCM.

### Setting up and building the SCM

As with all OpenIFS operations, the SCM depends on environment variables defined in `oifs-config.edit_me.sh`. i.e.

```bash
#---Path to the executable for the SCM. This is the
#---default path for the exe, produced by openifs-test.sh.
#---SP means single precision. To run double precision change
#---SP to DP
export SCM_EXEC="${OIFS_BLD_PARENT}/bin/MASTER_scm.SP"

#---Default assumed paths, only change if you know what you are doing
export SCM_TEST="${OIFS_HOME}/scripts/scm"
export SCM_VERSIONDIR="${OIFS_EXPT}/scm_openifs/48r1"
export SCM_PROJDIR="${SCM_VERSIONDIR}/scm-projects"
export SCM_RUNDIR="${SCM_PROJDIR}/ref48r1"
export SCM_LOGFILE="${SCM_RUNDIR}/scm_run_log.txt"
```

SCM environment variables depend on the `OIFS_HOME` and `OIFS_EXPT`, which are also defined by sourcing `oifs-config.edit_me.sh`

Before attempting to run the SCM, please follow the instructions in section [Set up the platform configuration file](#set-up-the-platform-configuration-file).

### SCM standard test-case package

The standard test-case package consists of 3 test-cases, each representative of different cloudy regimes:

* DYCOMS - marine stratocumulus case
* BOMEX - trade-wind cumulus case
* TWPICE - a multi-day deep convective case

This package can be downloaded by clicking [scm_openifs_48r1.tar.gz](https://openifs.ecmwf.int/data/scm/48r1/scm_openifs_48r1.tar.gz) or using `wget`, e.g. `wget https://openifs.ecmwf.int/data/scm/48r1/scm_openifs_48r1.tar.gz`.

Once downloaded unpack the package, e.g.

```bash
tar -xvf /path/to/scm_openifs_48r1.tar.gz
```

For ease of use with the standard OpenIFS environment variables, we recommend that the SCM test-case package is installed in `$OIFS_EXPT`, e.g.,

```bash
cp path/to/scm_openifs_48r1.tar.gz $OIFS_EXPT
cd $OIFS_EXPT
tar -xvzf scm_openifs_48r1.tar.gz
```

Once installed it is important to ensure that the `$OIFS_EXPT` is set to the directory that `scm_openifs` has been installed in. For example, in the template `oifs-config.edit_me.sh`, `$OIFS_EXPT=${HOME}/openifs-expt`. In this scenario, the directory `scm_openifs` needs to be in `$OIFS_EXPT` or `${HOME}/openifs-expt/`.

> Note: The untarred SCM package is small, ~45 Mb and data produced by a standard individual SCM simulation is also low. However, if a user is planning to perform many simulations and store the data, which is often the case, the disk space usage can become large. If this is the plan, then a user may need to consider installing the SCM test-case package on a larger disk area than $HOME.

### Run the SCM

Once the SCM test-case package installation has been completed, the SCM is run using the `callscm` script, which is a wrapper for the main `run.scm`. Both scripts can be found in `$SCM_TEST`, which is set in the `oifs-config.edit_me.sh` file to `${OIFS_HOME}/scripts/scm`.

`callscm`  includes default settings, which are the three cases, with a 450 s timestep and an experiment name of ref-oifs-scm. To run with these settings, enter the following

```bash
cd $OIFS_HOME
$SCM_TEST/callscm
```

> Note: If running on the ECMWF HPC the mpi environment needs to be loaded to avoid runtime MPI errors and SCM to fail with `callscm`. Use the following to load the environment

```bash
# If OpenIFS and SCM built with intel compiler use
module load prgenv/intel
module load intel-mpi
# if OpenIFS and SCM built with gnu compiler use
module load prgenv/gnu
module load gcc/11.2.0
module load openmpi/4.1.1.1
```

`callscm`  (with defaults, i.e. no arguments) will run the DYCOMS, BOMEX and TWPICE cases with the SCM and create an output directory in `$SCM_RUNDIR/scmout_DYCOMS_ref-oifs-scm_450s`, which contains the diagnostic output from the SCM. In addition, the file scm_run_log.txt will be created in `$SCM_RUNDIR`. This file contains the print output from the SCM, which is useful for checking all the sources and paths for a simulation.

#### `callscm` command-line options

Some of the `callscm` defaults can be changed through command-line options, e.g.

```
callscm -h -c <case_name or list of case_names> -t <timestep or list of timesteps>
        -x <expt_name>
where:
-h is help which returns basic usage options and exits
-c case_name or list of case_names (space delimited) of the case study
   used for namelist and output directory. Default list is
   "DYCOMS BOMEX TWPICE"
-t timestep or list of timesteps in seconds. The default is 450s. An
   example of a list is "1800 900 300"
-x expt_name shortname to identify experiment. Default is ref-oifs-scm
```

For example, if a user wanted to run the BOMEX case with timesteps of 1800 s and 900 s and an experiment name of "bomex_test", they would enter the following

```bash
$SCM_TEST/callscm -c BOMEX -t "1800 900" -x "bomex_test"
```

This command results in the following output directories `$SCM_RUNDIR/scmout_BOMEX_bomex_test_900s`  and `scmout_BOMEX_bomex_test_1800s`.
